# Assignment: In a file called indoor.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase.
# Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. Youâ€™re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.


# Prompt user for the input and store it in a variable
usertext = input("Enter something in all caps: ")

# Print the variable and format it using the .lower method
print(usertext.lower())
