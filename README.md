# CS50p Solutions
This repository contains my solutions for the problem sets in the Introduction for Computer Science with Python course offered by Harvard. I will be uploading the solutions as I complete the assignments.

# Note
If you're taking the course currently, I encourage you to work through the problem sets on your own, talk to the CS50 Duck AI, and only look up solutions when you've exhausted all other resources. You'll get the most out of the assignments this way.
