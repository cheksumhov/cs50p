# CS50p Solutions
This repository contains my solutions for the problem sets in Harvard's Introduction for Computer Science with Python course. I will be uploading the solutions as I complete the assignments.

# Note!
If you're taking the course currently, I encourage you to work through the problem sets on your own and only look up solutions when you've exhausted all other resources. You'll get the most out of the assignments this way.

# Assignments
Below are some links to the assignment details and a corresponding link to my solution. The code is commented with a brief explanation of my solution.
